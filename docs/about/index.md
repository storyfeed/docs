# Introduction

Storyfeed is an implementation of the activity stream pattern, which is a general way of representing syndicated activities in a social web application.

Examples:

> John posted a new photo to their profile

> Sarah liked a post from Mary

> Tom commented on a blog post by Jane

This pattern was first popularized by social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, but has since become a common feature in a variety of applications, including GitHub's home feed and many others.
